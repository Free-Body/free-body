      <p>
        Welcome to our website, where learning physics becomes an exciting
        adventure! We are dedicated to providing students with engaging and
        interactive games focused on free-body diagrams.

        At Free Body, we understand that learning physics can sometimes be
        challenging, which is why we have designed a collection of free games
        specifically tailored to help students grasp the fundamental concepts of
        free-body diagrams. These diagrams are essential in understanding the
        forces acting on objects and how they interact with their environment.
